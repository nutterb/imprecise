Title: Measurement Imprecision and Significant Figures

Description: Imprecision of measurement is an unavoidable aspect of laboratory 
  science. If not managed appropriately, results may lack sufficient accuracy 
  to obtain desired results. Imprecision is traditionally managed with significant figures, where a 
  significant figure is a digit in a reported value that is believed to have 
  the attribute of precision. The imprecise package adopts a philosophy that 
  precision of measurement is 
  best understood by understanding the limit of precision on the measuring 
  instrument. After understanding--and documenting--the precision of each 
  instrument, the determination of the appropriate significant figures is 
  a fairly simple exercise.
